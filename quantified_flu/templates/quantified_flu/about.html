        <h2 class=panel-title>What's the goal of the <em>Quantified Flu</em>?</h2>
      </div>

      <div class='panel-body'>
        <p>
          The question we want to answer is: <b>Can the various physiological parameters tracked by our wearables help to predict when we’re getting sick?</b>
          With the COVID-19 pandemic influencing all of our lives right now, this question seems more timely than ever. But it's not only the pandemic, the question
          equally applies to the flu and the common cold!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is some <a href='https://evidation.com/research/influenza-surveillance-using-wearable-mobile-health-devices/'>preliminary data</a> which shows
          that the data from wearables (like resting heart rate and sleep quality) might be predictive of coming down with a cold. Which offers a great opportunity
          for a collective citizen science approach!
        </p>

        <h3 class='panel-title'>Our approach</h3>
      </div>
      <div class='panel-body'>
        <p>
          Do you <b>have a wearable that you use regularly</b>? And maybe even <b>have used it in the past, while you were sick</b>? We would <b>love to collect those data</b> and <b>analyze them with your help</b>!

        </p>

        <p>
          There are <b>two ways you can use <em>Quantified Flu</em></b>:
            <ol>
              <li><b>Report past illnesses:</b> Report when you got sick in the past and share your wearable device data. <b>We'll make a plot of your data for you!</b></li>
              <li><b>Track symptoms going forward:</b> Sign up for daily check-ins to tell us if you got sick, your symptoms and viral test results.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          In the longer run we want to use these data to learn whether all those wearable signals can be used to train algorithms to predict when someone is falling sick,
          before the person is even consciously aware of it.

        <h2 class='panel-title'>Who will be able to access the aggregated data?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='panel-body'>
        <p>
          We plan to share the aggregated and de-identified data with individual researchers, for the expressed purpose of:
          <ul>
            <li>correlating the wearable data with the onset of sickness events</li>
            <li>gaining a better understanding of how sickness impacts our bodies prior and after onset</li>
            <li>building predictive models that use wearable data to forecast falling sick</li>
          </ul>
          In the long run we also want to provide the de-identified aggregate data as a public archive to maximize its use.
          If you don't want your data to be shared with others you <a href='{% url 'manage-account' %}'>can opt-out of sharing at any point by changing your account settings</a>.

      </div>
      <div class='panel-body'>
        <p>
          Right now we support the following wearable devices:
          <ul>
            <li>All wearables by <i>Fitbit</i></li>
            <li>The <i>Oura</i> Ring</li>
          </ul>
          There are many popular wearables, so if your wearable of choice is missing: Let us know <a href="mailto:support@openhumans.org">via email</a> or by <a href='https://slackin.openhumans.org'>joining our Slack</a>.
          If you're a programmer and would like to add support for your own wearable: Amazing!

      </div>
      <div class='panel-body'>
        <p>
          We're so sorry for that! We launched this website extremely quickly as we thought:
          the best day to start collecting data was yesterday. The second-best day to start collecting data is today.

          This means this page is a prototype that's under on-going development.

            This site can access and store various types of data for visitors
            and associated with connected accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you connect an Oura and/or Fitbit account, this site will access the
            following data and store it as an archive in your Open Humans
            account.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Your profile (age, weight, gender)</li>
            <li>Your sleep records</li>
            <li>Your activity records</li>
            <li>Your readiness records</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The site also stores the following data when you connect accounts
            from Oura and Open Humans.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>an anonymous identifier for your Open Humans account</li>
            <li>authentication credentials that allow us to read &amp; write your Oura archive on Open Humans</li>
            <li>authentication credentials that allow us to read your data from Oura</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Finally, this site's hoster
            <i><a href='https://www.heroku.com'>Heroku</a></i> stores and gives
            us access to the IP addresses of visitors, and pages visited on
            this site. These logs may be stored for up to a week.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can always delete your account and all associated data from
            the <a href="#"><i>Dashboard</i></a>.
            This includes the Open Humans and Oura/Fitbit authentication credentials,
            i.e. we won't be able to access your Open Humans &amp; Oura/Fitbit
            accounts any longer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Removing the authorization on Open Humans does not automatically
            delete your Oura archive on Open Humans; if you want this to occur,
            you should delete your account here before withdrawing from
            <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/activity/quantified-flu/">this
            project</a> in the Open Humans site.
