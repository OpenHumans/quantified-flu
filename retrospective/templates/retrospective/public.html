<h2>Public retrospective reports</h2>

<p>
  <b>Interested in analyzing this data yourself?</b> Each retrospective event report has data available via
  JSON endpoints. You can use this page's own JSON endpoint to automate data retrieval
  from these: <a href="{% url 'retrospective:public_json' %}">{% url 'retrospective:public_json' %}</a>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Please share your visualizations and discoveries with us!</b> People are excited to hear what you've
  done â€“ we'd love to share what others have done. (One place to connect is the
  <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T48QEEVTJ/CV5USP9BP">#quantifiedflu channel</a> in the Open Humans
  community Slack. You can use this site to create an account in the Slack: <a href="https://slackin.openhumans.org">slackin.openhumans.org</a>)
